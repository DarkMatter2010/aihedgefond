"""Documented research-trial Sharpes for DSR selection-bias correction.

``var_trial_sharpes`` for the Phase-3 gate MUST come from the dispersion of
independent research configurations actually tested — never from CPCV path
Sharpes (those share overlapping train/test windows and are not i.i.d. trials).

Source of ``RESEARCH_TRIAL_SHARPES`` (variance table)
----------------------------------------------------
Non-annualized daily IR proxies on the same scale as the gate's observed Sharpe
(CS long/short portfolio return mean/std). Values are Grinold-style
``Rank-IC * sqrt(median_cs_breadth)`` (rows 1–12 historically used breadth=50 /
Pearson IC; rows 13+ use the live run's Rank-IC and median breadth).

1. Phase-2 baseline h=5 (pre-CA diagnostics)     IC≈0.0106 → 0.075
2. 50-symbol IC validation                       IC≈0.010  → 0.071
3. test_start bar-gap fix                        IC≈0.010  → 0.071
4. Corporate-actions fix h=5                     IC≈0.0075 → 0.053
5. Feature-set expansion (#17) h=5               IC≈0.0049 → 0.035
6. Multi-horizon sweep h=1                       IC≈0.010  → 0.071
7. Multi-horizon sweep h=2                       IC≈0.0146 → 0.103
8. Multi-horizon sweep h=5                       IC≈0.0049 → 0.035
9. Multi-horizon sweep h=10                      IC≈−0.005 → −0.035
10. Multi-horizon sweep h=20                     IC≈−0.010 → −0.071
11. Momentum-breadth probe h=63                  rank_IC≈−0.009 → −0.064
12. Momentum-breadth probe h=126                 rank_IC≈−0.042 → −0.297
13. Universe-breadth diagnostic h=2 (broad)      rank_IC≈0.014808, N≈494 → 0.329
14. Feature-class triage reversal h=2            → 0.239
15. Feature-class triage reversal h=21           → 0.199
16. Feature-class triage low_vol h=2             → 0.375
17. Feature-class triage low_vol h=21            → 1.078
18. Feature-class triage range_vol h=2           → 0.075
19. Feature-class triage range_vol h=21          → 0.746
20. Feature-class triage all_new h=2             → 0.492
21. Feature-class triage all_new h=21            → 0.775
22. Feature-class triage new_plus_old h=2        → 0.335
23. Feature-class triage new_plus_old h=21       → 0.508

These are selection-bias inputs, not CPCV path diagnostics.

``N_RESEARCH_TRIALS`` (conservative count for DSR)
-------------------------------------------------
Bailey DSR uses ``n_trials`` for the expected-max-SR null under selection bias.
All 23 rows above are logged ICs from distinct configurations (12 legacy +
1 breadth diagnostic previously flagged but unlogged + 10 feature-class triage
configs = 5 classes × h={2,21}).

``N_RESEARCH_TRIALS = 23`` equals ``len(RESEARCH_TRIAL_SHARPES)`` — no defensive
round-up remaining once the breadth diagnostic and triage rows are logged.
Variance still comes from the full logged Sharpe tuple.
